## Welcome to my GitHub! :wave:

Hello! My name is Gracie Jackson. I'm currently attending Arizona State University for my Bachelor's degree in Graphic Information Technology: Full-Stack Web Development. Following my graduation, I hope to get a job in either the web development or game development field. I have always been very intrigued in the idea of creating new things.
Outside of school and coding I enjoy playing video games :video_game:, mixed martial arts :boxing_glove:, and reading :book:.
